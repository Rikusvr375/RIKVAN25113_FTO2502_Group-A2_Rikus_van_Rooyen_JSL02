# JSL02 Project Brief: Task Input and Status Validation System

## Overview

This project involves implementing a JavaScript-based task entry system where users can input two tasks with complete details, ensuring data consistency and validation. The system will guide users through entering valid task titles, descriptions, and statuses, enforcing correct formatting while maintaining code clarity and maintainability.

## Technologies Used
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- GitHub  
- VS Code  

## Resources Used
- Google  
- YouTube  
- ChatGPT  

## Features Used and Implemented
- A feature that asks for a certain project name, description, and whether the project classifies as a **TODO**, **DOING**, or **DONE** category.  
- If the user indicates that the project is to be completed but is not yet marked as done in both tasks, a message will pop up saying:  
  *"There are no projects done yetâ€”get to work!"*

## Expected Outcome

A functional task entry system that ensures accurate data collection, validation, and structured storage while maintaining clean and well-documented code for easy future modifications.
